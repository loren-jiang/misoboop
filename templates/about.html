        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>In creating this blog, I hope to bring a few key things to the dinner table:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3><strong>Practicality</strong></h3>
                If you’re looking for inspiration on wagyu beef recipes, this probably isn’t the place for you. For the
                most part, the recipes on this site will focus on ingredients and techniques readily accessible to the
                everyday home cook. There’s a time and occasion for extravagance, but I will try to share recipes that
                don’t require fancy kitchen accessories or ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><strong>Honesty</strong></h3>
                Cooking is all about trial and error -- some things taste great, others not so much, but the key thing
                is I won’t lie to you that they do. Instead, I’ll do my best to iterate and improve.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><strong>American cooking with Chinese roots</strong></h3>
                No, not literally ginseng… Raised on my mom’s cooking, I can assure you that Chinese dishes can
                sometimes be lackluster. The purpose of this blog isn’t to recreate authenticity, but rather to present
                Chinese dishes in a way that reflects the melting pot that is America.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>What's in a name?</h1>
        <p>Well...it’s pretty simple. My cat’s name is Miso and she likes to boop while I’m cooking.<br><br></p>
